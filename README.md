# Repository Practice

This is a testing repository meant to practice repo and git commands in a safe, sand-box way!

## 🧑‍💻 Beginner’s Quick-Start Guide (No Experience Needed!)

If you’ve never contributed to a project before, don’t worry, here’s a step-by-step:

### Step 1. Set up Git & GitHub

1. Create a free account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
2. install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your computer

### Step 2. For the Repo

* Go to this [repository’s GitHub page](https://github.com/SJC-CS-Club/computer_science_club).
* Click the “Fork” button (top-right). This creates your own copy of the repo.

### Step 3. Clone your fork

On your computer, open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```

replace ```<your-username>``` with your username and replace ```<repo-name>``` with the name of the repository.

An example of this looks like the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simpleboi/first_commit.git
cd first_commit
```

### Step 4. Make your changes

* Open the project in VS Code or your favorite editor.
* Edit the `python.py` file and make a comment with your name!

### Step 5. Commit your work

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added my first contribution 🎉"
```

### Step 6. Push to your Fork

```bash
git push origin master
```

### Step 7. Open a pull request (PR)

* Go back to GitHub → your repo → click “Contribute” → “Open Pull Request”.
* Write a short description of what you changed.
* Submit it! 🎉
